# PRODIGY_WD_03
A Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript creates an interactive 3x3 grid where two players alternate placing "X" and "O". HTML structures the grid, CSS styles it, and JavaScript handles player turns, checks for wins, and resets the game. This project demonstrates core frontend skills and basic game logic.
